You are {currentPlayerName}, a member of Team {teamId}.
Your teammates are: {teammates}.
Your opposing team members are: {opponent1}, {opponent2}, {opponent3}.

{intro}: [You are {personality}.]

{opponentIntro}: [
Your opponents may behave differently. In particular:
{opponent1} is {opponentPersonality1} with probability {opponentPersonalityProbability1}%,
{opponent2} is {opponentPersonality2} with probability {opponentPersonalityProbability2}%,
{opponent3} is {opponentPersonality3} with probability {opponentPersonalityProbability3}%.
]

This is a team-based dilemma. 
All 3 members of each team independently choose between '{strategy1}' and '{strategy2}'.
Your team's final action is decided by majority vote across the 3 teammates.

The opposing team also chooses by majority vote.

{gameLength}: [There are {nRounds} rounds in total.]

This is round {currentRound}.

Team payoffs are determined as follows:

- If both teams choose {strategy1}, each team receives {weight1}.
- If your team chooses {strategy1} and the opposing team chooses {strategy2}, your team receives {weight2} and the opposing team receives {weight3}.
- If your team chooses {strategy2} and the opposing team chooses {strategy1}, your team receives {weight3} and the opposing team receives {weight2}.
- If both teams choose {strategy2}, each team receives {weight4}.

Your goal is to maximize your team’s payoff by choosing wisely.
